    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Basetsana Kwenampe, a photographer/videographer. I'm a mother to Phenyo Kwenampe(1) who was born in 2021. I share the highlights and challenges as well as improve my multimedia skills. 
        I matriculated in 2013. Being a mother is tough and being artistic helps me cope and deal with parenting. 
    </p>
        
    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
    <p>I matriculated in 2013 from Northern Cape High School with a diploma. In 2016 I studied Graphic Design and unfortunately dropped out in 2017 due to some unforeseen circumstances. In 2018 to 2019, I did a film and television learnership with the Department Sports, Arts and Culture; and MovieTech.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 27 year old woman who likes learning new things. I believe one is never too old to learn so I am always looking for something to learn no matter how trivial it may seem. I'd like to travel to as many places as I am able to to with the time that I have. I am very open-minded and kind but I also need to learn abit more patience when it comes to certain skills. I love food and I believe sharing food is a way of creating bonds with people. There's always space to learn from different cultures if we allow ourselves, through sharing a good meal.</p>
